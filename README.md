Led a team to build a model that predicts the price of a house using historical data of a number of features. We focused more on achieving our final model from advanced regression algorithms like the Xgboost and Random forest algorithms.

This project was undertaken as a mini-project on the women Techsters Fellowship and as participation in a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)
